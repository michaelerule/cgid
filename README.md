# CGID libraries

Utility routines for interacting with the CGID datasets. These are
"cued grasping with instructed delay" task recordings from multi-
electrode arrays in primate motor cortex. 

These routines depend on [miscellaneous python routines for 
computational neuroscience](
http://michaelerule.github.io/neurotools/_build/html/index.html)

Rudimentary documentation is available on [github pages](

This read-me original contained the following grave disclaimer:

>   This is not a library, module or package. It should not be used

>   broken, all of the time, and this is intentional. This is 
>   internal code and depends on files not available in the

In reality, this repository is simply not-maintained and perpetually
"under construction". The hope is mainly that (1) if any code 
contained herein is ever found to be useful to anyone,
then it can be re-purposed and (2) should any future students work 
with multi-electrode array datasets, then this project provides and 
archive of past research code to facilitate reproducibility and 
future exploratory research. 

In the event that work concludes on said datasets, and if this 
project is able to obtain the data under a suitable license, then
the CGID datasets will be incorporated into this repository for
archival and reproducibility.

This project is published in the spirit (but not the letter) of the

a legal license as it contains internal inconsistencies (like 
forbidding users to exist). However, it contains a strong caution

re-use, the license itself is also "under construction".
