It seems that we're analyzing some units that may not be good, which is 
surprising given the effort made to identify good, beta periodic units, from
the outset. 

Something is amiss with how units are tagged as good, and also perhaps
with how units are accessed / indexed / identified. 

The new convention is to use 1-indexing for units, per MATLAB compatibility.
Arrays in Python are still zero indexed, so accessing should be corrected.
I doubt this is the source of the problem though. 

Like, Rusty '23 M1 unit 105 is not a good unit. Why is it here?
