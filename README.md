# CGID libraries

Utility routines for interacting with the CGID datasets. These are
"cued grasping with instructed delay" task recordings from multi-
electrode arrays in primate motor cortex. 
These routines depend on [miscellaneous python routines for 
computational neuroscience](
http://michaelerule.github.io/neurotools/_build/html/index.html).
Rudimentary documentation is available on [github pages](
http://michaelerule.github.io/cgid/_build/html/index.html).
